## Colonel Krisch (Hist.)

**Colonel Krisch** is a Latvian officer in the Russian Imperial Army. He is captured in 1916 alongside Kris Keidann and is taken to Prison Camp 16, in Jelgava. He commands a unit of mostly Latvians in the 6th Siberian Rifleman. Kriss finds him marching his troops in order - while singing - into the camp, a move that greatly demonstrate the Latvian morale and organization, even though captured.

Altought he is wild appearance, being a little overweight and with a rebellious beard, make him appear somewhat an oaf. He is an officer who both commands love and discipline from his soldiers. He later appears in Book 3 commanding the Bauska Regiment in the Latvian War of Independence.

**Historical Note:** [Krišs Ķūķis](https://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kri%C5%A1s_%C4%B6%C5%AB%C4%B7is) was a condecorated Latvian officer in the Russian Army, captured in 1916. In the books, there is some artistic liberties regarding his capture, unit and imprisonment (which are not documented), and in reality he actually managed to escape to England and returned to Latvia in 1919.


## Lieutenant-Colonel Dankers (Hist.)

**Lieutenant-Colonel Oskars Dankers** is a Latvian officer in the Russian Imperial Army. He is captured in 1916 togheter with Kris Keidann and Colonel Krisch and taken to Prison Camp 16. He is second-in-command to Krisch and orders Kris Keidann to fall in line in the column marching to prison - to have a better chance of survival - when he is found being captured by the germans. Dankers is, in the discussions among the prisioners - the one who advocates obeying the germans.

He later appears in book 3 fighting in the Bermontiade. 

**Historical Note:** [Oskars Dankers](https://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskars_Dankers) was a Latvian officer in the Russian Army, captured in 1916. In the books, there is some artistic liberties regarding his capture, unit and imprisonment (which are not documented). Unlike most of the other historical characters presented here, he was not captured in East Prussia (or in the northern front), but rather fought and was captured in Galicia by the Austro-Hungarian Empire, therefore, it was not possible for him to be in the same unit and prison as Colonel Krisch.

His despiction as advocating from obeying the germans in prison is also an artistic liberty based on the fact that later in life - during the Second World War - he left Latvia along other Baltic-Germans for Occupied Poland, and came back to Latvia during the Nazi invasion.

## Lieutenant Folgemanis (Hist.)

**Lieutenant 'Nik' Fogelmanis** is a Latvian officer already at Prison Camp 16 with the other inmates caputed since early 1915 and acts as Kris' direct officer in the camp, while also being a bridge between the higher officers and the enlisted soldiers.

He later appears in Book 2 in Ukraine and Southern Russia during the civil war.

**Historical Note:** [Nikolajs Fogelmanis](https://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolajs_Fogelmanis) was a Latvian officer in the Russian army. Captured in East Prussia in Early 1915, he managed to come back to Latvia in 1918. It is not known if he was kept at Jelgava. He was sent to Odessa in 1919.

## Captain Zemitans (Hist.)

**Captain Jorge Zemitans** is a Latvian officer at Prison Camp 16. Captured in early 1915 in Augustow. He is among the officers found in the camp. 

He later appears in book 2 and 3 during the War of Latvian Independence, fighting for the Northern Latvian Brigade and is the first Latvian Officer to affirm his full loyalty to the Latvian government. He consider's Balodis neutrality during the German push a betrayal to the Latvian government, but his lack of skills in politics makes him be dismissed from command in 1919.

**Historical Note:** [Jorģis Zemitāns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jor%C4%A3is_Zemit%C4%81ns) was a Latvian officer in the Russian army. Captured in Augustow in Early 1915.

## Captain Balodis (Hist.)

**Captain Janis Balodis** is a Latvian Officer at Prison Camp 16. Captured while resting in a field hospital during the Battle of the Masurian Lakes in 1915.

He later appears in book 2 and book 3, and after Kalpak's death, assumes commands of the Southern Latvian Brigade. He has a difficult position of mantaining his unit's focus against the enemy while under pressure, and his controversial decision to stay neutral during the German push puts his loyalties in question.


**Historical Note:** [Jānis Balodis](https://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C4%81nis_Balodis_(%C4%A3ener%C4%81lis)) was a Latvian officer in the Russian army. Captured in Augustow in Early 1915.

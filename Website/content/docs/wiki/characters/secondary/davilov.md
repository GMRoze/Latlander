**General Danilov** is Russian army general in the 12th Imperial Army and acts as the main "antagonist" of the first book. He rises to command of both Russian and Latvian forces after the disastrous Russians campaigns in East Prussia and is initially a sucessful commander, but soon turns sour as the tides turn.

A stubborn man, Danilov sends the Latvians to attack after attack in hopes of breaking the german lines. He also has a very strict policy against deserters, cowards or suspected traitors. He also begins to blame Latvians as the reason for his failure because of the Latvian actions against the russian empire during the 1905 revolution.

His laters persecutes Kris Keidann for being a supposed German Spy and forces the Latvian units to continue the attack during the Christmas Battles. Both actions eventually led to his downfall as he was captured after the socialist revolution and executed before the fall of Riga.

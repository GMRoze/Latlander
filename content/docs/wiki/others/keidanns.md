## Members

##### Elder Keidann

![](/Latlander/images/elder_keidann.png)

Elder Keidann, also called "Keidann The Warrior" was an ancient Kuronian warrior who supposedly lived around the 12th Century. According to oral tradition he lived with his wife and children around Aizpute and was part of his King's retinue. He was called into campaign as the pagans went to war with the Crusaders to defend their land. After a battle which cost the life of his king and his fellow brothers in arms, he returned to find his hometown burned and his sweetheart gone. With the german crusaders settling in to rule the land, he bent the knee and was baptized. His descendents would remain as small farmers bound to the orders of the local german barons for the next 800 years.

##### Colonel Jekabs Abrams

![](/Latlander/images/old_keidann.png)

"Colonel" Keidann, sometimes called "Old" Keidann, was the first Keidann to be appointed Steward of the manor and the patriarch of the modern Keidann family in Aizpute. Little is known about him except the fact he was born circa 1812 and had two sons. He went to serve in the Crimean War under the command of the local German baron and became his friend and confidant after saving his life in battle around 1855. In the same war, his eldest son disappeared. He was promoted to aide-de-camp (and thus, local people would call him "Colonel" even thought it was not his official title) and later Steward of the Baron's Manor, a job which involved managing his household and fields. From that day on, the responsability of managing the manor would be passed down from generation to generation of Keidann children.

However, he was also described as stern and distant man. He served faithfully as Steward for 17 years before his death and dedicated all his time to his responsabilities. Abrams describes his memories of him in his youth as a hollow-eyed man who did not love his grandson much. Whether this was his personality or grief from the loss of his wife and eldest son is not known. His legacy, however, cemented the Keidanns as a hard-working and respected family.

There is some evidence that even before him the family was already getting involved in local political affairs, as there is evidence his father was involved in the Napoleonic Wars in Russia to some extent, as the family has a small linen cloth worn by woman from that same time as a keepsake. It is also not know when Colonel Keidann joined the army before his son's disappearance, or if it was the cause for him to go to war.

##### Andrejs

![](/Latlander/images/granduncle.png)

The eldest son of Colonel Keidann, Abram's greatuncle was a young and willful youth, loved by both his father and his younger brother. Born circa 1830, not much is known about his personal life except the fact he joined the army shortly before the Crimean War and went to war, where he disappeared around 1854. 

For many years following the war, people expected him to come back from Ottoman captivity, but he never returned, and was still remembered fondly by those who knew him.

It is indicated, thought not confirmed, that he worked closely to the baron's household. He was known to be educated, as he loved art and literature, and was said to be incredibly skilled with horses and loved riding and supposedly gave riding lessons to the baron's sons and daughters.

It is possible that he was romantically involved with the Baron's daughter. As she is mentioned to have cried and she discovered he disappeared. No further explanation is given, however.

##### Martins

![](/Latlander/images/grandfather.png)

Martins was the youngest son of Jekabs Keidann. Not much is told about his life, and he himself admitted to being a simple man. He served the army but did not went to war, and for much of his life worked as a woodworker and lumberjack. He was not expected to inherit anything or have any responsabilities, so in these years he moved and worked in many surrounding villages other than Aizpute.

He met and became a friend of [Old Gertners](../historical/gertners) and the crescent baptist movement in Latvia. After his father's death he became the Steward of the Manor for the Old German Baron, a position which he did not love but executed dutifully. As a reward for his services and in respect of his father, the baron gave him a small lot of land to build the church. After Gertners died he also took care of the sunday services.

He was known to read and write, but only read simple texts either related to woodwork, fieldwork or simple theology. He could play the violin incredibly well and loved jolly tunes. He had a certain distaste for anything he deemed too fanciful and lived a modest life. Altought a closed person, he was known to be incredibly kind and caring. As he got older, he slowly passed away the responsabilities of the Manor to his son.

It is implied he had other older brothers other than Andrejs, the fate and where these brothers might be is unknown. He was born around 1831 and died in 1899.

##### [Jahn Abrams](../../characters/primary/father)

![](/Latlander/images/father.jpg)

Jahnis Abrams, sometimes just called "Abe" or Mr. Keidann, was the son of Martins Keidann. Born around 1865, he grew up helping his father in the responsabilities of the German Manor. He loved reading and writing, but being of modest birth, he was only interested in simple literature. He also loved music but never had the talent to play the violin like his father did. 

He dedicated his entire life for the Manor and the Church, and very rarely had time for other responsabilities. He met his future wife in a church trip to Jelgava in 1886 but they would marry many years later. From around 1886 to 1892 he served the obligatory military service in the Russian Empire, and was recognized as the best marksman in his regiment.

They had two children: Markuss and Kristaps, and lived a confortable. He had already assumed most of the duties of the Manor in 1892 and was named the Steward after Martin's death in 1900 - but by that time the position had pratically become a caretaker of the house, as the german family that lived there rarely came to visit. He also temporarily took care of the church services from 1889, and headed the proposal of calling a dedicated baptist pastor from the Baptist association, thus bringing the [Anderman Family](../andermans) to Aizpute.

Despiste his bear-size like appearance, he was known to be extremely kind and with an unwavering sense of duty - but he also doubted his capacity to lead other people, and often questioned his abilities as a father face a modernizing world.

In 1905, he stood against the striking farmhands and workers as he considered his personal responsability to keep the Manor working. For that manner, he enlisted the help of his son Markuss, already grooming him to continue the tradition of stewardship. Later that year he stood against the more revolutionary sects in Aizpute, but helped the wounded during the 1905 Revolution.

He is the one to lead the wagon trail of refugees from Aizpute during the start of the German Invasion of Courland. With the decision to leave his home, closing his manor and his church hurting him deeply. He died in 1915 after being shot by deserters in the road to Riga.

##### [Markuss](../../characters/primary/markuss)

![](/Latlander/images/markuss.jpg)

Lieutenant Markuss Keidann is the eldest son of Jahn Abrams, born in 1895. In his childhood he really loved listening to his grandfather's bedtime stories about his family and listening to him play the violin. He was known as a shy but energetic and wilful kid who would follow his father everywhere. When he discovered he would have a brother, he got so excited at the idea of having a friend to play with that he stood long hours in front of the door while his mother gave birth, and due to his brother's fragile health, would spend most of the days of his early childhood doing so.

His mother constantly noted he was smart, but to study he had to go to the Lutheran school, which was kilometers away and he was constantly doubled-guessed by his professors because of his baptist denomination, giving him a small distaste for formal education until the baptist school was opened a couple of years later. He also always wanted to play the violin, but never learned properly because he was afraid of playing for more than a few minutes, since he abhorred the idea of him annoying people by playing it wrongly.

He quickly became friends with Anna and Gustavs Anderman, and in late 1904 started to develop feelings for Anna. During the opening days of the 1905 Revolution in Aizpute, he escaped his protective curfew in home to visit her, and after standing up to protect her and his brother, he receives a scar in his left cheek by a Russian Commander, and is only spared when a soldier intervenes. This action would sharply shape his beliefs in authority as he grew up.


##### [Kristaps](../../characters/primary/kris)

## Customs and Traits

Keidanns have a reputation for being hard-workers and having a somber, melancholic-like temperament. Being related to the Curonian Kings and having (probably) been given more freedom than the other peasants during the medieval and modern age, they have kept strong family traditions. Be in their cooking and taste for poetric ballads to the their family pride and military tradition. Almost all known members of the family have served in the military at one point, with most of the members being affiliated with the Artillery Regiments. There's also a tradition of passing from generation to generation a small linen cloth from the Napoleonic times from wife to wife of the eldest son.

Since the 18th century, the family takes care of custodial responsabilities of the Baptist Church (which they helped found) and the local german manor, which they take care as Stewards: tending to the finances, reforms and good state and fields.

Aside from that, people who know Keidanns also usually recognize their tendency to have golden-brownish hair. They don't have a confirmed coat of arms but usually identify with Courland's heraldry.

## Breezehome \ The Homestead

![](/Latlander/images/homestead.jpg)

The Keidann family has lived in the same plot of land for hundreds of years - a small Homestead in the pine woods belonging to the manor. The house is described as a "ship of Theseus" - with so many reforms that the original parts have long been replaced. Currently, it is made of mostly wood planks and small red bricks, with the kitchen center having a very old stone stove. The homestead has a small garden (usually shadowed by the tall trees) and other small wooden log buildings, such as a toolshack and a sauna.

Markuss notes that the house itself had the marks of many and many generations of Keidanns, with the support of the door to the kitchen having so many notches of the height of past children there was no longer space for Kriss.

As per Latvian tradition, every household is named, and the Homestead's name, written on a small wood plaque, is _Wesmamaya¹_, or _Breezehome_ in Latvian. It is unknown who first named it. And it is quite possible the naming was prior to Colonel Keidann's time.

The house is surrounded by a small stone wall and Markuss recalls that sometimes there were stones stacks around the place - making him suggest there may have been stone buildings before.

## Trivia

- "Keidann" is the surname of a Latvian-Brazilian family estabilished in Ijui in the late 1890's. Among the members of the Brazilian Keidann family were baptist pastors and members of the Latvian-Brazilian Baptist Association.

- The modern latvian spelling of the name is "Keidans", with variantions being Keidan in Yiddish and Kedahnen in German.

- There is a Lithuanian city called Kėdainiai, whose foundation is attributed to a rich Curonian merchant called [Keidangen](https://web.archive.org/web/20060417163730/http://postilla.mch.mii.lt/Tevuzeme/kedainiai.htm) 

- "Colonel", such as the case of Jekabs Abrams, is a honorific title common in rural Brazil usually used by local landlords and large cattle ranchers, regardless of the true military title.

- Both Abrams of the family, Jekabs Abrams and Jahnis Abrams, lose their sons in war. In this case, the imagery of the Binding of Isaac is evoked, with God asking Abraham to sacrifice his loved child. The passage in the Bible teaches that complete obedience to God should ignore doubts if the act itself seems morally right or wrong. In the bible, God replaces Isaac with a lamb in the sacrifice. In the story, however, both fathers lose their sons.

**Captain Fritz Barder** is a German officer of the 9th Army and the "antagonist" of the last half and third book. A dark, subtle influence, he fought in Belgium and France before being assigned to the Eastern Front. It is unclear when he first fought in Latvia (he later lies to Markuss saying he was in the western front during the entirety of the war) but by 1917 he was already working in the military police and military intelligence in the Riga front.

In 1917, he interrogates Gustavs after the latter is captured trying to enter german-controlled Courland. He later appears as a Latvian ally during the liberation of Courland and strikes a "friendship" with Markuss. He is later present when commander Kalpaks dies by friendly fire. After this event, he is called to personally help Von der Goltz plan his betrayal of the Latvian forces.

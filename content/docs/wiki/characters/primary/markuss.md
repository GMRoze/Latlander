Second-Lieutenant **Markuss Keidann**  is a Latvian commanding officer of the 3rd Courland Battalion (and later, Regiment) as a colleague of [First-Lieutenant Wilks](../wilks) and acts as the main "protagonist" of the story. Born in 1895 in Aizpute and raised in the local baptist church, he was the oldest son of Mr. and Mme. Keidann and brother of [Kriss Keidann](../kriss), whom he had a rocky relationship.

He joined the army in late 1913, but his low fluency of Russian and enmity of the high command, he is relegated to serve in the 

Born into a simple family in Aizpute and raised in the baptist faith, Markuss was called to serve the army just before the war started, becoming a brave soldier and officer.

In 1917, Markuss defies general Davilov's orders to protect his brother Kris but continues in the army right until the Battle of Riga. For his differences with the new Socialist government, Markuss and his fellow anti-bolshevik officers (with the exception of Wilks) are considered a _persona non-grata._ He flees Riga, receiving a shot wound in his leg leaving him almost paralized for a year in 1917, and returns to his hometown in german-occupied Kurzeme.

In 1918 he joins the newly formed independent Latvian Army as a Lieutenant and fights in the war until its final days, being present in every major event until the battle of Daugavpils. For his actions in the war of independence he is nicknamed _the Lion of Kurzeme_ for his ferocity and his lion-like appearence.

He marries Anna in 1917 and his first daughter is born in 1919.


# Appearance and Character

Markuss is a stocky, green eyed and auburn haired Keidann, resembling his father. Keidann is a kind and patient man, fond of smiling, but also sometimes sad or troubled by the increasing violence of the war. Altough a brave soldier, he is sometimes regarded as a bad or foolish tatician, being constantly berated by Wilks for compromising the victory in battle when forced to make costly maneuvers.

Tought not educated formally besides his local school in Aizpute, Markuss is mild-mannered with a faint "rednecky" charm. He is a strong follower of the Baptist church and puts great importance with his relation with Pastor Frejss. Markuss personally holds the view that war is horrible, but not the worst thing that can happen to men. He holds the opinion that the best choice is always the one that saves those under his command, but as an officer sometimes has trouble in giving commands that deaths might lead to "the greater good".

(or as Lewis puts it: To kill or to be killed in war is not murder. Rather, war is a species of punishment that may require our death or the death of the enemy, but we cannot hate or enjoy hating those we kill. Punishment is necessary, but we cannot enjoy that which we must do. He even suggests that if in World War I some young German and he had simultaneously killed one another, the moment after their death neither of them "would have felt resentment or even any embarrassment. I think we might have laughed over it.")

After losing his brother and being almost paralized in 1917, Markuss becomes a lot more bitter and sad before being reinspired to fight for an independent Latvia. -->

# Book 1

**Act I**

Markuss was born in [Breezehome](../../others/breezehome), the Keidann's ancestral home near [Aizputes Manor](../../others/manor), in 1895. The first child of [Abrams Keidann](../father) and [Lavise Keidann](../mother), he grew up in the local [baptist church](../../others/church). As a child he often accompanied his father in his work and church reunions, and was well-loved by both his parents and the other villagers of Aizpute.

He was greatly excited when he discovered he would have a brother, but due to Kriss' poor health, Markuss often found himself waiting for hours outside his door to play. He was very close to his paternal [grandmother](../grandmother), who often told him stories about his [ancestors](../../others/keidanns), and was deeply affected when she passed away in [1900](../../others/timeline#1900). Because of her stories, Markuss loved knights and often imagined swords when playing with sticks.

Markuss met the [Andermann family](../../others/andermanns) in Christmas [1902](../../others/timeline#1902) and quickly became friends with the Andermann brothers. He was also enrolled when the local school opened but due to his older age he never grew into a great student as his brother. He helped Anna emotionally when her mother was sick in [1904](../../others/timeline#1904) and was devastated when the Andermanns moved away in following the [1905 Revolution](../../others/aizputes_kars).

During the 1905 Revolution in Aizpute, he escaped the protective curfew to meet Anna. In the same day, he gained his distinctive scar in his left cheek after he stood up to the [Commander](../punitive_commander) of a [Russian Punitive Expedition](../../others/aizputes_kars#expedition), only to be saved from further physical punishment by a soldier. An experience that deeply inspired him to become a soldier and protect others.

Following 1905, his father started taking him to work in the manor and the fields to compensate for the lack of workers. Due to this, Markuss grew up as a hard working but lonely teenager. He also resented being expected to continue the Keidann tradition of being the steward of the local german manor and longed for a life of his own.

In his 18th Birthday in 1913, Markuss has an altercation with his Father - who seemingly forgot his birthday - only for him to revel his surprise: teaching how to hunt. While hunting Markuss expresses his wish to join the Russian Imperial Army, a decision which his father is hesitant to accept, warning Markuss that while he wants his son to follow his dreams, a career in the army is not what he may expect to be. Both men also discuss whether Kriss should be allowed to go study music in Riga's Conservatory. For the first time, Markuss feels he talks to his father as an equal.

Later, his mother and father accompany him to the recruiting station in Jelgava, and Markuss is told by the recruiter of how the Army has enacted further restrictions on local minorities, but decides to enlist anyway. After his mother displays the first symptomps of tuberculosis in the travel back, Markuss shames Kriss for not helping the family.

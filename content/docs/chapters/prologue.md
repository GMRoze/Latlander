## Prologue
### The Disappearance of Kristaps Keidann
#### Autumn 1915. 2nd Latvian Riflemen Regiment, 24 miles from Riga.

The day dawned clear and serene. The sun was bright as amber, the sky blue as young maidens’ eyes and the top of trees swayed with the sound of distant German artillery.

If not for this occasional, low tum of German howitzers, localized around 12 miles south, the forest would be in complete silent. An inattentive wanderer would barely spot the soldiers – dressed in their Russian brownish uniform – face-down in the floor, still as statues. No order of silence had been given, but no men dared to break that stillness silent of the morning.

The 2nd Rifle Regiment, formed recently with the local factory workers from the Latvian city of Riga, had spent the entire morning digging trenches, although the result of their work had been no more than a few, half-meter deep, holes in the ground which they had to lay if they wanted protection. The 9th German Army had advanced, always with sinister speed, crossing the frontier with the provinces of Lithuania into Latvia. Since late-1914 they had pushed the Imperial Russian Army further and further into its homeland, and this very morning were swallowing allied units into the south. The artillery the 2nd regiment was now falling on the head of some poor bastard, and would soon be falling on theirs, in that calm and serene forest.

Tum. The artillery barrage was rhythmic, a clock reminding each men of the duty they will soon have to fulfil. They were not more than factory workers, farmhands, and craftsman – some too young enough to have beards, some too old enough to have hair. Most never touched a gun before, but still they fashioned themselves as soldiers, warriors of their land – the same land they now lied face-down - protecting their home against the German crusader, as their ancestors had done in the 13th century.

Each of those men used their silence differently. There, lying behind those small mounds of earth they dug, some prayed, others gazed the endless corridors formed by the trunks of the conifers, looking closely to spot any incoming German boche. No man dared to break the silence, except for a young lad – carrying two boxes of ammunition – running between the trenches and trees. He just came back from the Headquarters with the last supplies the 2nd would receive before the attack.
“God bless ye, Kris”, whispered the sergeant as he pushed the soldier that lied by his side to make space for the newcomer, and Kristaps was quick to lay down. Each gathered a few magazines from the wooden crate and stuffed their pockets. “Any idea on who’s getting the beatin’?”, the soldier by his side asked as he lighted up a cigarette. He had to decide whether to keep the extra magazine or the cigarettes in his pocket.

“Must be 1st Regiment”, answered the sergeant. “and don’t let Wilks catch you doing that.”, he chuckled as he saw the soldier light up his cigarette. “it affects combat readiness”

“Aye, combat readiness”, repeated the soldier, in a monotone, slightly mocking, fashion. “Why bother”, half-chuckled the soldier, “I think the damned bastards in the 1st Regiment getting shelled by the boche are having an easier time than us with Wilks. Poor bastards…”, he put his cigarette in his mouth, sometimes his hands shook. “Know anyone from the 1st, sarge?”

“Nay, don’t think so.”, answered the sergeant, trying to sound uninterest, “Do you, Kris?”. Kris did not want to be dragged in the conversation between the soldier and his sergeant. It was eerily uncomfortable for him to speak of their comrades in arms this way. Every man wants to look tough, his father often said, and he somehow knew deep down that every soldier in that forest was just as scared as him, but each faced the calm before the storm in his own way.
Yes, he wanted to say, I do know some bastards getting shelled at the 1st regiment. They are my friends. But what was the point? Is the fact that he has a friend in the 1st going to change the fact that they are getting smashed by the Germans? Is his response going to stop the mockery his trench colleagues? Why bother, he repeated with the monotone fashion of the soldier in his head.

But he also wanted to say that it was a queer day for war. He had ignored the conversation of his colleagues to observe the treetops. The majestic green conifers of the forest – the aptly named Riga pines - framed the blue sky above them, and they danced and shook with every tum of the German artillery. The fresh air of morning sometimes breezed through the tight corridors of trees, carrying the fragrance exhaled by the falling leaves in that brownish ground below. It seemed too calm and beautiful, too still, and serene for war. No. He wanted to say it was not a day for war, it was a day for picnics.
He remembered the Saturdays of his childhood, when his mother woke up early to bake and his father left to cut trees. His father would come home by lunch smelling of pine and wood, and they would all sit tight together in the small wooden table at their home and lunch. Him, mother, father, and his brother. Oh, his brother. They would play after lunch while father slept, and mom took the bread off the oven. They would pack their homemade breads and homemade jelly in a small checkered blanket and head off into the forest near his home. They would sit wherever was comfortable and spent the evening together…  “Know anyone, Kris?”

“I…”, Kristaps said after some moments of silence. His answered was not directly to any of his trench colleagues, as he still stared the sky. And for some fleeting seconds, he imagined himself like a child again. It all reminded him: the forest, the pines, the brownish dirt, his brother. “How queer life has changed…”

Tum, answered the German howitzer. The thundering sound of artillery seemed ever so close. Some place south of that forest, some poor bastard of the 1st regiment had his arms and legs blown – and the day looked awfully fitting for a picnic. What happened to those days? It wasn’t long ago; he was 16 years old that autumn, barely the age to be a soldier. He still had time, time to go home, time to spend with his father, with his mother. 16 years old. He was still young… was he?

Tum. Turum. Turum. Turumturum. It was not a German shell that answered him this time, but a rapid trotting that echoed in the forest. Kris tried to lift his head up from the ground, but the sergeant held him. “Horse!”, the sergeant tried to murmur to the men in the trench, but his tone was audible. “No movement to the right”, the soldier next to him uttered trying to hold the cigarette in his mouth, while checking the surroundings with his rifle, “ours or theirs?”
Turumturumturum.

“Ours or theirs?!”, the soldier asked again. “How would I know?” uttered the sergeant, “Kris, watch the tree line to the left”. “I think it’s…”, Kris started to say.

Turum. The figure of a man mounted on a horse emerged from the indistinguishable tree lines and stood right before the men in the trench, the horse stopped a few meters from their small hole. The rider, who wore the same brownish Russian imperial uniforms, gasped for some air, and recomposed himself.

“Friendly…”, he gasped for more air, not only him but the horse seemed exhausted. He lifted a small piece of paper with his arm. “Is this the 1st Regiment?”

The sergeant rose from the hole in the ground and stepped forward, placing his rifle in his shoulder. “Sorry lad, this is Riga’s 2nd”

“Sarge…?”, the soldier by Kris’ side seemed uneasy. But his voice was muffled by a distant, strong tum of German artillery.

“Bollocks,” exclaimed the rider, “they cut off our comms. Who’s your commanding officer?”

“Ol’ Wilks, he is. But you can find the 1st regiment heading right this way…”, the sergeant moved his arm with an open palm towards the south side. 

The soldier right by Kris’s side dropped his cigarette. “Sarge!”

Too late, Bang. A bullet cut the rider’s chest. The sarge stepped back clumsily before jumping back in the hole. Another bullet just hit a tree right beside him. “Boches!”, he screamed, but his voice was muffled by the sound of the machine gun in the rear lines opening fire to the invisible enemy in the forest.

The rider was still half-mounted, with his bleeding chest, but the deafening sound of guns scared the animal, which rode and jumped the trench, fleeing from the shots. The rider fell face down. “They must have seen or followed the horse!”. Pieces of wood and leaves and the fleeting bright traces of bullets filled the forest. “Eyes on the trees!”

“It must ‘ave come from the right”, said the soldier, but so far none of the men in the trench could distinguish trees from Germans. Kris tried to get up, but the sarge held him.

Kris froze in place. The rider, face-down in the ground, tried to lift his body up, but blood flowed from his arms and face into the ground. He fell.

“Kris, no!”, ordered the sergeant, but the deafening noise of bullets, officers' whistles and explosions made the order inaudible, and if Kris did hear it, he would not obey. He jumped from the trench and rushed to the fallen rider. He turned the man upwards and pushed him to their half-meter dirt mound.

“Su… Surrounded”, blood dripped from the rider’s mouth as he was dragged across the muddy ground of the forest, “they are going to be surrounded…”.  As soon as they reached the trench the soldier pushed both into that small hole in the ground.
“Bastards!”, the sarge dropped his rifle and started pressing the rider’s chest, blood pumped up. “They hit him good.” The sergeant pulled the small, now bloodied, paper from the rider’s hands and gave it to Kris. “Keidann, keep this”. The sarge called him Kris as a friend, Keidann, that was an order.

Whoever had followed the horse was now retreating. Or waiting. “They must be recon checking our line”, said the soldier, shooting whenever he saw movement in the trees, “they didn’t hit us full yet”. “Keidann, legs”, said the sarge, as he held up the rider from his arms and shoulders. “When we hear silence, we run”. The machineguns had stopped and only a few bullets were being exchanged by the men in the trenches. So far, the fighting was slowing down after minutes of starting.

Silence.

“Hold the line”, said the sergeant, as he and Kris and the sergeant rose to carry the rider to his hospital.

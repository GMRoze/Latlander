  Christmas 1905. In Aizpute, Province of Courland, Latvia, part of the Russian Empire.
  <a class="anchor" href="#christmas-1905-in-aizpute-province-of-courland-latvia-part-of-the-russian-empire">#</a>
</h4>
<p>There, on top of a small hill surrounded by the wheat fields of Courland, stood a gigantic Oak tree whose brown trunk and green leaves contrasted with the white-painted boards of the baptist church behind it. The Oak tree stood like a silent sentinel of the land: it had seen the times that land was filled with other Oaks like it, now it stood alone.</p>
<p>Four children played under it: the brothers Markuss and Kris Keidann, and brothers Anna and Gustavs Anderman. The Oak tree had seen their birth, it had also seen their ancestors. It had seen the German crusaders and missionaries when they invaded, many centuries ago. It gave shade to many Curonian soldiers tired. It saw many marriages, it also saw many funerals.</p>
<p>It saw the first Keidann’s take their name, after the germans won the war. The germans settled on the land, constructing palaces and solars, while the ones - old pagan soldiers like the first Keidann - became peasants.
It saw Markuss' grandfather - a woodchopper like his father, and his father before him - took down the last remaining oaks to build that small baptist church. The germans didn’t like it, but they respected the Keidann family enough to allow it. The Keidann family were always the faithful keepers of that temple, painting the white boards, cleaning the benches before service, cutting the overgrown grass from the small cemetery.</p>
<p>It had also seen the Anderman family arrive: the church was new and small, only the Keidanns and some local families attended it regularly. Old Keidann had been the temporary preacher, but he had only the basics of education. When he died, the congregation called for a trained preacher, and Riga sent them one: Anderman.</p>
<p>Pastor Anderman, as he was called, had only one eye. He was a veteran missionary from the holy land, where disease of some kind had affected his eye, which would not open anymore.</p>
<p>It was the Keidanns who received the Andermans when they first arrived in the village, Aizpute. They had provided lodgement and their house in the center, and soon became friends. Anderman was the pastor but the Keidanns were their faithful right hand. And so Mr. Keidann and Mr. Andermans kids were raised together.</p>
<p>Markuss Keidann, the oldest - but no older than 12 - liked to imagine great knights and wars of the past. He ran through the wheat fields imagining where his ancestors lived. He liked to believe he was the heir of a line of great kings and warriors of Curonia - a thought his father, a simple woodchopper - did not often agree with. Anna Anderman was almost as old as Markuss, and she liked books better than people. She often sat near the tree reading books as big as her, reciting out loud the stories of the past, which the other kids would recreate, but often found herself frustrated when they did not follow as she instructed. Gustavs, her brother, often emulated Markuss, although he was not as old and big.</p>
<p>Kris - Markuss’ brother - however, was often aloof of the chivalric battles of the others. He wandered around the church, looking for branches and cute things. He liked music not swords. Kris - for all of his good heart - was not very popular with other kids.</p>
<p>The Oak was a silent observer. It saw the kids play, it saw the kids fight, and if God willed it, it would also see them marry, but their lives would change fast.</p>
<p>The year was 1905, until now it had been a normal year for them, for country kids cared little about the wars and politics of the adults in the cities, but even them could tell it was a queer year. Strikes had begun all over the empire, and workers stopped working - and the hotspot of these rebellions had been their native provinces in Latvia. The Latvians marched in streets, chanting for justice or bread or better rights.</p>
<!-- 

To be fair, the Oak Tree was older than the church - in fact - it was as olden as the land of Latvia.

It stood there alone in that hilltop, inviting travellers far and wide to its church.


 beneath an olden Oak Tree played four children whose names were Markuss, Kris, Ana and Gustavs.

The 12th army had marched and marched further west. Down from Courland in Latvia to the old duchy of Lithuania into the german lands, Prussia. Their ranks were mixed from all of those in the Russian Empire: Poles, Ukranians, Lithuanians, Latvians, from even those further into Asia. The Latvians alone were thousands, scattered among different units. Many languages all ordered by the russian officers.

But Prussia had been a failure. The Russians went marching but returned in retreat. The Masurian Lakes, the woods of Augustow, Wilks had seen it all: battle after battle, loss after loss. Soldiers, with their russian brown shirts or their grey german overcoats, lied across the fields. Cows - those who were not taken by the armies to feed - were shot to deny the enemy the chance. 

Empty wooden houses, with only toys to remember the passing soldiers kids ever lived there. All valuables taken and the ones left looted. Carts abandoned by the mud-roads that led further and further into Russia. Fields and villages torched by either side, as corpses handed from trees - traitors, thieves - and deserters tied and shot into sullen trunks of trees.

Wilks had seen the latvians dead in the muds and pits of East Prussia. They marched in as thousands but returned as hundreds.

# --

They often marched under the beating of feet into the muddy ground. The lithuanians slapped their rifles in their backs, imitating pagan drums and sang an old Commonwealth war song, from the times they once dominated Europe with their lances and winged hussars. It was a war song, like the war songs their ancestors sang when they fought the Teutonic Knights at Grunwald:
<br><br>
_Oh, dear rowan tree, where have you been growing in the midst of the swamps?_ <br>
_Ei ei aiaiai, in the midst of the swamps?_ <br>
_Where have you been growing in the midst of the swamps, in the green moss?_ <br>
_Ei ei ajajaj, in the green moss?_ <br>
 
Oh, dear mother, what have you raised me up for?
Ei ei ajajaj, what have you raised me up for?
 
What have you raised me up for and conscripted me to a war?
Ei ei ajajaj, and conscripted me to a war?
 
Conscripted me to a war and have forged me three trumpets?
Ei ei ajajaj, and have forged me three trumpets?
 
He trumpeted the first trumpet as he was riding off from the inner yard
Ei ei ajajaj, as he was riding off from the inner yard
 
He trumpeted the second trumpet as he was riding off from the outer yard
Ei ei ajajaj, as he was riding off from the outer yard
 
He trumpeted the third trumpet as he was joining the troops
Ei ei ajajaj, as he was joining the troops
 
My horse pranced and all the troops looked at me
Ei ei ajajaj, all the troops looked at me
 
And all the army had turned to me
Ei ei ajajaj, the army to me
 
And a troop of Swedes has come, a troop of brave ones
Ei ei ajajaj, a troop of brave Swedes
 
When we've stood in the field, we've knocked all the Swedes out
Ei ei ajajaj, we've knocked all the Swedes out
 
Our Chodkewicz was very strong, he was a real king
Ei ei ajajaj, he was a real king.

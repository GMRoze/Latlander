<p><strong>Mr. Keidann</strong> is a Latvian lumberman father of Markuss and Kris Keidann. Born in Aizpute to the olden Keidann family, he worked his entire life as a lumberman and carpenter. He also served the obligatory service in the Russian Imperial Army in his youth, being one of the best marksman in his unit.</p>
<p>A faithful baptist, he was the main responsible for the construction of the Baptist Temple in Aizpute and always helped prepare the temple for christmas - a season he loved. In 1905, he lost his unborn daughter and barely lost his wife as the church was burn down by the Russian Army.</p>
<p>He later had trouble raising his two kids. Altough a loving and caring father, he was sometimes distant or too strict, because he feared losing them. His promise of letting Kris join the Symphonic Orchestra if he passed the exams, and his change of heart, led to Kris leaving home. He died in 1915 as the German Army invaded Latvia.</p>

  Appearance and Character
  <a class="anchor" href="#appearance-and-character">#</a>
</h1>
<p>Mr. Keidann is a tall, stocky man. His golden/auburn hair and beard gave him a wild, lion-like appearence. He was extremely patient and well manered and tried to raise his sons as best as he could, but he also admits his faults. He was overprotective of his sons after losing his infant daughter in 1905.</p>
<p>With Markuss, Mr. Keidann always pushed him to do heavy work and help him to cut trees to pay for Kris' studies, and also did not let Markuss leave home until after he served in the army and married, which led to Markuss resent a little his father&rsquo;s controll.</p>
<p>With Kris, Mr. Keidann always saw his father&rsquo;s talent with music and the violin and wanted to be able to afford Kris' education and entrance in Riga&rsquo;s Symphonic Orchestra (it is implied Mr. Keidann&rsquo;s father was very talented with a violin, but had to be a lumberjack in his life because he couldn&rsquo;t pay for the education, and Mr. Keidann always wanted to play music as well as Kris did, but never had the opportunity), but when Kris finally passed the exams, he feared losing his son and prohibited his leave.</p>

  <article class="markdown"><p><strong>Elijah &lsquo;Eli&rsquo; Augstroze</strong> (sometimes written as Elija), is a music student at Rigas Conservatory and colleague of Kris. Born in Kuldiga to a low-middle class family of salesman, Elijah grew as a quiet and reserved kid and musically talented with the violin. He eventually had the opportunity to study in Rigas Conservatory, but while he excelled at his studies, he often found himself alone or unloved.</p>
<p>While in Riga, he was an infrequent member of the Baptist Church where Pastor Anderman preached - altought his faith was strong, so were his doubts on himself and the promise that he was loved. While he met Kris in his first year in the Conservatory, they did not become friends at first, with Kris barely noticing his existence until they met at the top of the Conservatory roof - and only identifying that both had prospected, and somewhat even desired, suicide, that they formed a bond.</p>
<p>Elija&rsquo;s relationship with Kris would fluctuate as both often found themselves more aligned with being misfits than by common tastes - but he is instrumental in Kris' arc of maturity and self-confidence. Elijah, however, struggles and fails to find his self-confidence, but is not seen further in the first book.</p>
<p>In the first act of the second book, Elijah plays a more instrumental role when Markuss starts working at Kuldiga. Elijah falls deeper and deeper in a state of depression as people around him constantly ignore him until his suicide in christmas 1918. Only four people attend his funeral: the priest, his mother, Markuss and his brother, who arrives later. His will only asked for his grave to write the &lsquo;truth&rsquo;: <em>Known by few, loved by none</em></p>
<p>Despiste being a minor character, he is extremely important in both Kris' arc in the first book and his change towards re-evaluating how he seeks acceptance in society, and later in Markuss' arc in the second book as the guilt for having ignored his failing mental health pushes Markuss to war again.</p>
<p>Kris constantly thinks on Elijah and his unwavering faith in the existence God, and most of his chapters he refers to the <em>God of Elijah</em>, which not only refers to God but Elijah&rsquo;s idea of God. Kris was also aware of Elijah&rsquo;s paradoxical faith on himself: he could believe in everything in the bible except his own worth. Elijah&rsquo;s doubts on himself often guilted him.</p>
<p>It is implied that Elijah questions his own identities, his commitment to his values and even his sexuality. And his spiral into despair is further enhanced as people around him gaslight him or guilt him, this is most proeminent when Anastasia accuses him of using his depression as a weapon against her. His suicide in the first act of the second book resounds in many characters, even those who had little contact with him. With many either feeling guilt of not having payed attention before and others accusing his suicide as being a last ploy of attention.</p>
<h2 id="notes">
  Notes
  <a class="anchor" href="#notes">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Elijah is inspired by Sufjan Stevens - specially regarding his faith and sexuality. As both can be experienced in his songs as of the same substance: of joy and of shame. The interwoven layers of both a fight against depression in his lyrics with a reflection on God and on love bring a new - more complete - aspect of what a human emotions are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apart from the biblical profet, a few songs inspired the choosing of the name Elijah: Matthew and the Atlas' &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo;, and Sufjan Steven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Drawn to the Blood&rdquo;. And later his explorations in sexuality with Sufjan Steven&rsquo;s &ldquo;John My Beloved&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elijah&rsquo;s suicide and his brother&rsquo;s arrival in the story following the event are inspired by the author&rsquo;s personal experience with the suicide of a acquaintance, and the remaining guilt of not having been a passive, innatentive - and oftentimes, uncaring - observer of the process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- While I know that Elijah's sexuality and suicide would be taboo subjects, I stand by my decision. I think if executed correctly, it invites an healthy discussion on both subjects. The shame and doubt of not fully understanding your sexuality - specially in your darket moments - and the results of a deteriorating mental health when people are left without support. In fact, I'd love to explore how divisive a suicide can be, and how its ripples can affect other people long after it has happened--></article>

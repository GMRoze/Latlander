<p><strong>Lieutenant Wilks</strong> is a Latvian-Jewish commanding officer of the 3rd Courland Battalion (and later, Regiment). An accomplished commander, Wilks' is sometimes regarded as ruthless or unbending, being called <em>Ol' Wilks</em> or <em>Slavedriver</em> by his soldiers. He is a veteran of the invasion of East Prussia and the fall of Jelgava before the formation of the Latvian Riflemen. After the Christmas Battles in January 1917, he is removed from service after retreating without orders and a mutiny against General Davilov and goes on to have a pivotal role in the Russian Civil War commanding the Red Latvian Riflemen, until returning to fight for the independence of Latvia.</p>
<p>At the end of the war, Wilks has been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel of the Latvian forces. He eventually receives the moniker of <em>the Wolf of Vidzeme</em> for his actions.</p>
<h1 id="appearance-and-character">
  Appearance and Character
  <a class="anchor" href="#appearance-and-character">#</a>
</h1>
<p>Wilks' face is described as palid, borderline sickly white, with hazy distant grey eyes and a pine-brown short hair. In the beggining of the book, he keeps his beard trimmed and his hair kept but as the book progresses the grooming standarts of the battalion and of himself start to decay. He bears a scar in his neck, sometimes hidden by his uniform, from his experience in Prussia.</p>
<p>Despiste not being muscular or tall, he remains an imposing figure. His gaze is sometimes described as either incredibly stern or incredibly unconcerned, depending of the matter at hand. Extremely learned, he is patient and rarely raises his voice to speak. He speaks in a paced, monotone manner and rarely demonstrates any emotion, altough he sometimes remarks things with irony.</p>
<p>Tough mild-mannered, Wilks is considered remorseless, cold, cunning, rarely-forgiving but also a strong-willed and resoluted commander. In battle, he is not foreign to the idea of deadly battle plans or sometimes even sacrificing units if it is required to achieve victory, but more often than not manages to win with &ldquo;the least casualties&rdquo;. While not loved by his soldiers or sometimes feared, he does hold the respect of those he commands.</p>
<p>Personally, Wilks regards the duty of a soldier as no different from anyother duty. It is the job of a soldier to follow orders and the job of officers to command. He firmly believes that it is morally unjust to disobey orders, since it can endanger your fellow soldier and that only fighting to the end will end the war. He often evokes the idea of <em>lesser evil</em> to justify his actions, altought he recognizes it&rsquo;s only a pragmatic stance.</p>
<p>As the story progresses, Wilks comes to lose part of his faith in following the orders of Russian generals, but remains strictly committed to winning the war until the deadly Christmas Battles, where he loses 1/3 of his soldiers after being abandoned and betrayed by the Russian Generals. In the aftermath of the Christmas Battles, he supports Markuss Keidann and is consequently imprisioned and dismissed from the army, being imprisoned until February 1917, when he is released by the Socialists to act as judge in the revolutionary tribunals.</p>
<p>After his betrayal by the Russian generals, his overall atitude becomes much more remorseless and unforgiving, with him being the head judge in the judgement of Russians officers. Altough, he later comes to regret some of his actions.</p>

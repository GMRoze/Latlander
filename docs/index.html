<p><em>The Latlander</em> is an war novel set in Latvia during the First World War. Starting in the 1905 Revolution, it covers the epic story of the Great War and the War of Independence. It is based on my historical research of the events, but also mixed with artistic liberties and personal stories I collected from the families involved in the events.</p>
<p>The original plot is three books long: Book I covers the 1905 revolution and the childhood of the Keidann brothers and follows the Great War until the Christmas Battles in 1916/1917. Book II begins with the Socialist Revolutions in Russia and the Fall of Riga and follows the Russian Civil War, the declaration of Independence of Latvia and the liberation of Kurzeme in 1918/1919. The last book covers the Bermontiade and the end of the Latvian War of Independence.</p>

<p>With its first outline of the plot written in 2015 (revised, edited, deleted, etc... and the current plot outline 2017). I finally gained the courage to write and publish the chapters in this website as they are finished. I have also added a wiki to help readers understand characters, locations, events <strong>(contains spoilers)</strong>.</p>
<p>I have always loved the idea of seeing an author constructing the world he writes and that&rsquo;s why I created this website and hosted it in github: It will be a great way to see the development of chapters and ideas, and I can also add notes not only about historical research or other minor ideas for readers to delight themselves in (if they want to, of course) but also some other pieces of art and media that I used to create the world of the Latlander.</p>

<p>I grew up hearing stories from my family. I consider hearing and sharing stories as the greatest legacy a human can leave to his world. I am not a writer nor I intend to be, and neither do I intend to monetize this work. I&rsquo;m but a simple man with a lot of stories in his mind that need to be written down. That&rsquo;s why this book is published for free online.</p>
<p>I believe art to an integral part of society, and it&rsquo;s ok for artists to monetize their work, but it is not the path I will follow with this book. I like to believe that I&rsquo;m just the teller of this story, but it goes far beyond me (and indeed it does, since it is inspired by the stories Latvian families told me about the First World War) and therefore I consider all input very welcome. If you&rsquo;d like to enrich the universe with your own ideas. I&rsquo;m all ears.</p>

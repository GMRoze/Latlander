Born into a simple family in Aizpute and raised in the baptist faith, Markuss was called to serve the army just before the war started, becoming a brave soldier and officer.\nIn 1917, Markuss defies general Davilov\u0026rsquo;s orders to protect his brother Kris but continues in the army right until the Battle of Riga. For his differences with the new Socialist government, Markuss and his fellow anti-bolshevik officers (with the exception of Wilks) are considered a persona non-grata. He flees Riga, receiving a shot wound in his leg leaving him almost paralized for a year in 1917, and returns to his hometown in german-occupied Kurzeme.\nIn 1918 he joins the newly formed independent Latvian Army as a Lieutenant and fights in the war until its final days, being present in every major event until the battle of Daugavpils. For his actions in the war of independence he is nicknamed the Lion of Kurzeme for his ferocity and his lion-like appearence.\nHe marries Anna in 1917 and his first daughter is born in 1919.\nAppearance and Character #  Markuss is a stocky, green eyed and auburn haired Keidann, resembling his father. Keidann is a kind and patient man, fond of smiling, but also sometimes sad or troubled by the increasing violence of the war. Altough a brave soldier, he is sometimes regarded as a bad or foolish tatician, being constantly berated by Wilks for compromising the victory in battle when forced to make costly maneuvers.\nTought not educated formally besides his local school in Aizpute, Markuss is mild-mannered with a faint \u0026ldquo;rednecky\u0026rdquo; charm. He is a strong follower of the Baptist church and puts great importance with his relation with Pastor Frejss. Markuss personally holds the view that war is horrible, but not the worst thing that can happen to men. He holds the opinion that the best choice is always the one that saves those under his command, but as an officer sometimes has trouble in giving commands that deaths might lead to \u0026ldquo;the greater good\u0026rdquo;.\n(or as Lewis puts it: To kill or to be killed in war is not murder. Rather, war is a species of punishment that may require our death or the death of the enemy, but we cannot hate or enjoy hating those we kill. Punishment is necessary, but we cannot enjoy that which we must do. He even suggests that if in World War I some young German and he had simultaneously killed one another, the moment after their death neither of them \u0026ldquo;would have felt resentment or even any embarrassment. I think we might have laughed over it.\u0026quot;)\nAfter losing his brother and being almost paralized in 1917, Markuss becomes a lot more bitter and sad before being reinspired to fight for an independent Latvia.\nHistory #  [To be completed]\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/latlander/docs/chapters/prologue/','title':"Prologue",'section':"Chapters",'content':"Prologue #  The Disappearance of Kris Keidann #  Autumn 1915. 2nd Latvian Riflemen Regiment, 24 miles from Riga. #  The day dawned clear and serene. The sun was bright as amber, the sky blue as young maidens’ eyes and the top of trees swayed with the sound of distant German artillery.\nIf not for this occasional, low tum of German howitzers, localized around 12 miles south, the forest would be in complete silent. An inattentive wanderer would barely spot the soldiers – dressed in their Russian brownish uniform – face-down in the floor, still as statues. No order of silence had been given, but no men dared to break that stillness silent of the morning.\nThe 2nd Rifle Regiment, formed recently with the local factory workers from the Latvian city of Riga, had spent the entire morning digging trenches, although the result of their work had been no more than a few, half-meter deep, holes in the ground which they had to lay if they wanted protection. The 9th German Army had advanced, always with sinister speed, crossing the frontier with the provinces of Lithuania into Latvia. Since late-1914 they had pushed the Imperial Russian Army further and further into its homeland, and this very morning were swallowing allied units into the south. The artillery the 2nd regiment was now falling on the head of some poor bastard, and would soon be falling on theirs, in that calm and serene forest.\nTum. The artillery barrage was rhythmic, a clock reminding each men of the duty they will soon have to fulfil. They were not more than factory workers, farmhands, and craftsman – some too young enough to have beards, some too old enough to have hair. Most never touched a gun before, but still they fashioned themselves as soldiers, warriors of their land – the same land they now lied face-down - protecting their home against the German crusader, as their ancestors had done in the 13th century.\nEach of those men used their silence differently. There, lying behind those small mounds of earth they dug, some prayed, others gazed the endless corridors formed by the trunks of the conifers, looking closely to spot any incoming German boche. No man dared to break the silence, except for a young lad – carrying two boxes of ammunition – running between the trenches and trees. He just came back from the Headquarters with the last supplies the 2nd would receive before the attack. “God bless ye, Kris”, whispered the sergeant as he pushed the soldier that lied by his side to make space for the newcomer, and Kristaps was quick to lay down. Each gathered a few magazines from the wooden crate and stuffed their pockets. “Any idea on who’s getting the beatin’?”, the soldier by his side asked as he lighted up a cigarette. He had to decide whether to keep the extra magazine or the cigarettes in his pocket.\n“Must be 1st Regiment”, answered the sergeant. “and don’t let Wilks catch you doing that.”, he chuckled as he saw the soldier light up his cigarette. “it affects combat readiness”\n“Aye, combat readiness”, repeated the soldier, in a monotone, slightly mocking, fashion. “Why bother”, half-chuckled the soldier, “I think the damned bastards in the 1st Regiment getting shelled by the boche are having an easier time than us with Wilks. Poor bastards…”, he put his cigarette in his mouth, sometimes his hands shook. “Know anyone from the 1st, sarge?”\n“Nay, don’t think so.”, answered the sergeant, trying to sound uninterest, “Do you, Kris?”. Kris did not want to be dragged in the conversation between the soldier and his sergeant. It was eerily uncomfortable for him to speak of their comrades in arms this way. Every man wants to look tough, his father often said, and he somehow knew deep down that every soldier in that forest was just as scared as him, but each faced the calm before the storm in his own way. Yes, he wanted to say, I do know some bastards getting shelled at the 1st regiment. They are my friends. But what was the point? Is the fact that he has a friend in the 1st going to change the fact that they are getting smashed by the Germans? Is his response going to stop the mockery his trench colleagues? Why bother, he repeated with the monotone fashion of the soldier in his head.\nBut he also wanted to say that it was a queer day for war. He had ignored the conversation of his colleagues to observe the treetops. The majestic green conifers of the forest – the aptly named Riga pines - framed the blue sky above them, and they danced and shook with every tum of the German artillery. The fresh air of morning sometimes breezed through the tight corridors of trees, carrying the fragrance exhaled by the falling leaves in that brownish ground below. It seemed too calm and beautiful, too still, and serene for war. No. He wanted to say it was not a day for war, it was a day for picnics. He remembered the Saturdays of his childhood, when his mother woke up early to bake and his father left to cut trees. His father would come home by lunch smelling of pine and wood, and they would all sit tight together in the small wooden table at their home and lunch. Him, mother, father, and his brother. Oh, his brother. They would play after lunch while father slept, and mom took the bread off the oven. They would pack their homemade breads and homemade jelly in a small checkered blanket and head off into the forest near his home. They would sit wherever was comfortable and spent the evening together… “Know anyone, Kris?”\n“I…”, Kristaps said after some moments of silence. His answered was not directly to any of his trench colleagues, as he still stared the sky. And for some fleeting seconds, he imagined himself like a child again. It all reminded him: the forest, the pines, the brownish dirt, his brother. “How queer life has changed…”\nTum, answered the German howitzer. The thundering sound of artillery seemed ever so close. Some place south of that forest, some poor bastard of the 1st regiment had his arms and legs blown – and the day looked awfully fitting for a picnic. What happened to those days? It wasn’t long ago; he was 16 years old that autumn, barely the age to be a soldier. He still had time, time to go home, time to spend with his father, with his mother. 16 years old. He was still young… was he?\nTum. Turum. Turum. Turumturum. It was not a German shell that answered him this time, but a rapid trotting that echoed in the forest. Kris tried to lift his head up from the ground, but the sergeant held him. “Horse!”, the sergeant tried to murmur to the men in the trench, but his tone was audible. “No movement to the right”, the soldier next to him uttered trying to hold the cigarette in his mouth, while checking the surroundings with his rifle, “ours or theirs?” Turumturumturum.\n“Ours or theirs?!”, the soldier asked again. “How would I know?” uttered the sergeant, “Kris, watch the tree line to the left”. “I think it’s…”, Kris started to say.\nTurum. The figure of a man mounted on a horse emerged from the indistinguishable tree lines and stood right before the men in the trench, the horse stopped a few meters from their small hole. The rider, who wore the same brownish Russian imperial uniforms, gasped for some air, and recomposed himself.\n“Friendly…”, he gasped for more air, not only him but the horse seemed exhausted. He lifted a small piece of paper with his arm. “Is this the 1st Regiment?”\nThe sergeant rose from the hole in the ground and stepped forward, placing his rifle in his shoulder. “Sorry lad, this is Riga’s 2nd”\n“Sarge…?”, the soldier by Kris’ side seemed uneasy. But his voice was muffled by a distant, strong tum of German artillery.\n“Bollocks,” exclaimed the rider, “they cut off our comms. Who’s your commanding officer?”\n“Ol’ Wilks, he is. But you can find the 1st regiment heading right this way…”, the sergeant moved his arm with an open palm towards the south side.\nThe soldier right by Kris’s side dropped his cigarette. “Sarge!”\nToo late, Bang. A bullet cut the rider’s chest. The sarge stepped back clumsily before jumping back in the hole. Another bullet just hit a tree right beside him. “Boches!”, he screamed, but his voice was muffled by the sound of the machine gun in the rear lines opening fire to the invisible enemy in the forest.\nThe rider was still half-mounted, with his bleeding chest, but the deafening sound of guns scared the animal, which rode and jumped the trench, fleeing from the shots. The rider fell face down. “They must have seen or followed the horse!”. Pieces of wood and leaves and the fleeting bright traces of bullets filled the forest. “Eyes on the trees!”\n“It must ‘ave come from the right”, said the soldier, but so far none of the men in the trench could distinguish trees from Germans. Kris tried to get up, but the sarge held him.\nKris froze in place. The rider, face-down in the ground, tried to lift his body up, but blood flowed from his arms and face into the ground. He fell.\n“Kris, no!”, ordered the sergeant, but the deafening noise of bullets, officers' whistles and explosions made the order inaudible, and if Kris did hear it, he would not obey. He jumped from the trench and rushed to the fallen rider. He turned the man upwards and pushed him to their half-meter dirt mound.\n“Su… Surrounded”, blood dripped from the rider’s mouth as he was dragged across the muddy ground of the forest, “they are going to be surrounded…”. As soon as they reached the trench the soldier pushed both into that small hole in the ground. “Bastards!”, the sarge dropped his rifle and started pressing the rider’s chest, blood pumped up. “They hit him good.” The sergeant pulled the small, now bloodied, paper from the rider’s hands and gave it to Kris. “Keidann, keep this”. The sarge called him Kris as a friend, Keidann, that was an order.\nWhoever had followed the horse was now retreating. Or waiting. “They must be recon checking our line”, said the soldier, shooting whenever he saw movement in the trees, “they didn’t hit us full yet”. “Keidann, legs”, said the sarge, as he held up the rider from his arms and shoulders. “When we hear silence, we run”. The machineguns had stopped and only a few bullets were being exchanged by the men in the trenches. So far, the fighting was slowing down after minutes of starting.\nSilence.\n“Hold the line”, said the sergeant, as he and Kris and the sergeant rose to carry the rider to his hospital.

Wilks",'section':"Characters",'content':"Lieutenant Wilks is a Latvian-Jewish commanding officer of the 3rd Courland Battalion (and later, Regiment). An accomplished commander, Wilks' is sometimes regarded as ruthless or unbending, being called Ol' Wilks or Slavedriver by his soldiers. He is a veteran of the invasion of East Prussia and the fall of Jelgava before the formation of the Latvian Riflemen. After the Christmas Battles in January 1917, he is removed from service after retreating without orders and a mutiny against General Davilov and goes on to have a pivotal role in the Russian Civil War commanding the Red Latvian Riflemen, until returning to fight for the independence of Latvia.\nAt the end of the war, Wilks has been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel of the Latvian forces. He eventually receives the moniker of the Wolf of Vidzeme for his actions.\nAppearance and Character #  Wilks' face is described as palid, borderline sickly white, with hazy distant grey eyes and a pine-brown short hair. In the beggining of the book, he keeps his beard trimmed and his hair kept but as the book progresses the grooming standarts of the battalion and of himself start to decay. He bears a scar in his neck, sometimes hidden by his uniform, from his experience in Prussia.\nDespiste not being muscular or tall, he remains an imposing figure. His gaze is sometimes described as either incredibly stern or incredibly unconcerned, depending of the matter at hand. Extremely learned, he is patient and rarely raises his voice to speak. He speaks in a paced, monotone manner and rarely demonstrates any emotion, altough he sometimes remarks things with irony.\nTough mild-mannered, Wilks is considered remorseless, cold, cunning, rarely-forgiving but also a strong-willed and resoluted commander. In battle, he is not foreign to the idea of deadly battle plans or sometimes even sacrificing units if it is required to achieve victory, but more often than not manages to win with \u0026ldquo;the least casualties\u0026rdquo;. While not loved by his soldiers or sometimes feared, he does hold the respect of those he commands.\nPersonally, Wilks regards the duty of a soldier as no different from anyother duty. It is the job of a soldier to follow orders and the job of officers to command. He firmly believes that it is morally unjust to disobey orders, since it can endanger your fellow soldier and that only fighting to the end will end the war. He often evokes the idea of lesser evil to justify his actions, altought he recognizes it\u0026rsquo;s only a pragmatic stance.\nAs the story progresses, Wilks comes to lose part of his faith in following the orders of Russian generals, but remains strictly committed to winning the war until the deadly Christmas Battles, where he loses 1/3 of his soldiers after being abandoned and betrayed by the Russian Generals. In the aftermath of the Christmas Battles, he supports Markuss Keidann and is consequently imprisioned and dismissed from the army, being imprisoned until February 1917, when he is released by the Socialists to act as judge in the revolutionary tribunals.\nAfter his betrayal by the Russian generals, his overall atitude becomes much more remorseless and unforgiving, with him being the head judge in the judgement of Russians officers. Altough, he later comes to regret some of his actions.\nHistory #  [To be added]\nMacOS MacOS Content Linux Linux Content Windows Windows Content  --"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/latlander/docs/chapters/act_i/3_war/','title':"Chapter III: War is Declared / The Shelling of Liepaja",'section':"Act I",'content':"Chapter III #  War is Declared / The Shelling of Liepaja #  Autumn 1914.

The younger brother of Markuss Keidann, Kristoffs run from home in April 1914 after being prohibited to join the Riga Symphonic Orchestra by his father and brother. He lost communication with his family when the war started.\nHe volunteers to join Latvian Riflemen in 1915, but being the youngest in his company, he was often lightly mocked by his fellow soldiers. In autumn 1915, he leaves his post in an heroic but foolish attempt to warn units south of his position that they will be annihilated if they do not retreat immediatly (it is later revealed he did that because he thought his brother Markuss could be amongst them)\nFinding Kris becomes Markuss\u0026rsquo;s main objective during the first half of the first book, but when he is later found in Death Island, he refuses to leave the army - regarding his duty as a soldier to his fellow brothers in arms. He is injured by mustard gas in Death Island and almost dies before being rescued by Markuss.\nBack in Riga, he is accused by Russian Officers (and specially, general Davilov) of cowardice before the enemy and being a spy for german forces, with the help of Markuss, he escapes prison - but instead of saving himself he rushes to the frontline to stop the attack on the Christmas Battles, as Wilks and the Latvian Riflemen will die since the Russians have decided to leave the Latvian to die. He manages to save the Riflemen but dies by his wounds.\nAppearance and Character #  Kris, like his brother, is an \u0026ldquo;golden haired\u0026rdquo; Keidann, but with a slim face and expressive eyes he inherited from his mother. He is less stocky than almost all of his fellow soldiers. Kris is at the same time very intelligent but also unaware of his social faus-passes. He likes to comments historical or cultural facts - mostly with a good humour - which often falls in deaf ears of his unwitting trench comrades. He speaks thing in a very fast but also dead-pan way, which is often received with laughter from his friends.\nA skilled musician and violinist, Kriss usually writes songs or poems about his experience. He rarely shows any of his writings to his friends, with the exception of a baudy poem he wrote to mock his friend\u0026rsquo;s battle injury. Even from a very young age, Kris has always showed an exceptional talent of understanding people and situations, and he has a very good technical knowledge on an increasing amount of skills - which is often contrasted by his inability to put it into practice.\nKris is not personally a skilled soldier and often does not put himself in harm\u0026rsquo;s way, but during the course of the book he changes from trying to prove himself to his brother and father to making real decisions to save his fellow soldiers, even tought it may cost his life.\nHistory #  [To be completed]\n"});})();

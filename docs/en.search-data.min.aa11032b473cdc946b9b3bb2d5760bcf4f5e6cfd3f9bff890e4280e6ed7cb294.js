Born into a simple family in Aizpute and raised in the baptist faith, Markuss was called to serve the army just before the war started, becoming a brave soldier and officer.\nIn 1917, Markuss defies general Davilov\u0026rsquo;s orders to protect his brother Kris but continues in the army right until the Battle of Riga. For his differences with the new Socialist government, Markuss and his fellow anti-bolshevik officers (with the exception of Wilks) are considered a persona non-grata. He flees Riga, receiving a shot wound in his leg leaving him almost paralized for a year in 1917, and returns to his hometown in german-occupied Kurzeme.\nIn 1918 he joins the newly formed independent Latvian Army as a Lieutenant and fights in the war until its final days, being present in every major event until the battle of Daugavpils. For his actions in the war of independence he is nicknamed the Lion of Kurzeme for his ferocity and his lion-like appearence.\nHe marries Anna in 1917 and his first daughter is born in 1919.\nAppearance and Character #  Markuss is a stocky, green eyed and auburn haired Keidann, resembling his father. Keidann is a kind and patient man, fond of smiling, but also sometimes sad or troubled by the increasing violence of the war. Altough a brave soldier, he is sometimes regarded as a bad or foolish tatician, being constantly berated by Wilks for compromising the victory in battle when forced to make costly maneuvers.\nTought not educated formally besides his local school in Aizpute, Markuss is mild-mannered with a faint \u0026ldquo;rednecky\u0026rdquo; charm. He is a strong follower of the Baptist church and puts great importance with his relation with Pastor Frejss. Markuss personally holds the view that war is horrible, but not the worst thing that can happen to men. He holds the opinion that the best choice is always the one that saves those under his command, but as an officer sometimes has trouble in giving commands that deaths might lead to \u0026ldquo;the greater good\u0026rdquo;.\n(or as Lewis puts it: To kill or to be killed in war is not murder. Rather, war is a species of punishment that may require our death or the death of the enemy, but we cannot hate or enjoy hating those we kill. Punishment is necessary, but we cannot enjoy that which we must do. He even suggests that if in World War I some young German and he had simultaneously killed one another, the moment after their death neither of them \u0026ldquo;would have felt resentment or even any embarrassment. I think we might have laughed over it.\u0026quot;)\nAfter losing his brother and being almost paralized in 1917, Markuss becomes a lot more bitter and sad before being reinspired to fight for an independent Latvia.\nHistory #  [To be completed]\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/latlander/docs/chapters/prologue/','title':"Prologue",'section':"Chapters",'content':"Prologue #  The Burning Church #  Christmas 1905. In Aizpute, Province of Courland, Latvia, part of the Russian Empire. #  There, on top of a small hill surrounded by the wheat fields of Courland, stood a gigantic Oak tree whose brown trunk and green leaves contrasted with the white-painted boards of the baptist church behind it. The Oak tree stood like a silent sentinel of the land: it had seen the times that land was filled with other Oaks like it, now it stood alone.\nFour children played under it: the brothers Markuss and Kris Keidann, and brothers Anna and Gustavs Anderman. The Oak tree had seen their birth, it had also seen their ancestors. It had seen the German crusaders and missionaries when they invaded, many centuries ago. It gave shade to many Curonian soldiers tired. It saw many marriages, it also saw many funerals.\nIt saw the first Keidann’s take their name, after the germans won the war. The germans settled on the land, constructing palaces and solars, while the ones - old pagan soldiers like the first Keidann - became peasants. It saw Markuss' grandfather - a woodchopper like his father, and his father before him - took down the last remaining oaks to build that small baptist church. The germans didn’t like it, but they respected the Keidann family enough to allow it. The Keidann family were always the faithful keepers of that temple, painting the white boards, cleaning the benches before service, cutting the overgrown grass from the small cemetery.\nIt had also seen the Anderman family arrive: the church was new and small, only the Keidanns and some local families attended it regularly. Old Keidann had been the temporary preacher, but he had only the basics of education. When he died, the congregation called for a trained preacher, and Riga sent them one: Anderman.\nPastor Anderman, as he was called, had only one eye. He was a veteran missionary from the holy land, where disease of some kind had affected his eye, which would not open anymore.\nIt was the Keidanns who received the Andermans when they first arrived in the village, Aizpute. They had provided lodgement and their house in the center, and soon became friends. Anderman was the pastor but the Keidanns were their faithful right hand. And so Mr. Keidann and Mr. Andermans kids were raised together.\nMarkuss Keidann, the oldest - but no older than 12 - liked to imagine great knights and wars of the past. He ran through the wheat fields imagining where his ancestors lived. He liked to believe he was the heir of a line of great kings and warriors of Curonia - a thought his father, a simple woodchopper - did not often agree with. Anna Anderman was almost as old as Markuss, and she liked books better than people. She often sat near the tree reading books as big as her, reciting out loud the stories of the past, which the other kids would recreate, but often found herself frustrated when they did not follow as she instructed. Gustavs, her brother, often emulated Markuss, although he was not as old and big.\nKris - Markuss’ brother - however, was often aloof of the chivalric battles of the others. He wandered around the church, looking for branches and cute things. He liked music not swords. Kris - for all of his good heart - was not very popular with other kids.\nThe Oak was a silent observer. It saw the kids play, it saw the kids fight, and if God willed it, it would also see them marry, but their lives would change fast.\nThe year was 1905, until now it had been a normal year for them, for country kids cared little about the wars and politics of the adults in the cities, but even them could tell it was a queer year. Strikes had begun all over the empire, and workers stopped working - and the hotspot of these rebellions had been their native provinces in Latvia. The Latvians marched in streets, chanting for justice or bread or better rights.\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/latlander/docs/chapters/act_i/2_birthday/','title':"Chapter II: Birthday",'section':"Act I",'content':"Chapter II #  Birthday #  Spring 1914.

Wilks",'section':"Characters",'content':"Lieutenant Wilks is a Latvian-Jewish commanding officer of the 3rd Courland Battalion (and later, Regiment). An accomplished commander, Wilks' is sometimes regarded as ruthless or unbending, being called Ol' Wilks or Slavedriver by his soldiers. He is a veteran of the invasion of East Prussia and the fall of Jelgava before the formation of the Latvian Riflemen. After the Christmas Battles in January 1917, he is removed from service after retreating without orders and a mutiny against General Davilov and goes on to have a pivotal role in the Russian Civil War commanding the Red Latvian Riflemen, until returning to fight for the independence of Latvia.\nAt the end of the war, Wilks has been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel of the Latvian forces. He eventually receives the moniker of the Wolf of Vidzeme for his actions.\nAppearance and Character #  Wilks' face is described as palid, borderline sickly white, with hazy distant grey eyes and a pine-brown short hair. In the beggining of the book, he keeps his beard trimmed and his hair kept but as the book progresses the grooming standarts of the battalion and of himself start to decay. He bears a scar in his neck, sometimes hidden by his uniform, from his experience in Prussia.\nDespiste not being muscular or tall, he remains an imposing figure. His gaze is sometimes described as either incredibly stern or incredibly unconcerned, depending of the matter at hand. Extremely learned, he is patient and rarely raises his voice to speak. He speaks in a paced, monotone manner and rarely demonstrates any emotion, altough he sometimes remarks things with irony.\nTough mild-mannered, Wilks is considered remorseless, cold, cunning, rarely-forgiving but also a strong-willed and resoluted commander. In battle, he is not foreign to the idea of deadly battle plans or sometimes even sacrificing units if it is required to achieve victory, but more often than not manages to win with \u0026ldquo;the least casualties\u0026rdquo;. While not loved by his soldiers or sometimes feared, he does hold the respect of those he commands.\nPersonally, Wilks regards the duty of a soldier as no different from anyother duty. It is the job of a soldier to follow orders and the job of officers to command. He firmly believes that it is morally unjust to disobey orders, since it can endanger your fellow soldier and that only fighting to the end will end the war. He often evokes the idea of lesser evil to justify his actions, altought he recognizes it\u0026rsquo;s only a pragmatic stance.\nAs the story progresses, Wilks comes to lose part of his faith in following the orders of Russian generals, but remains strictly committed to winning the war until the deadly Christmas Battles, where he loses 1/3 of his soldiers after being abandoned and betrayed by the Russian Generals. In the aftermath of the Christmas Battles, he supports Markuss Keidann and is consequently imprisioned and dismissed from the army, being imprisoned until February 1917, when he is released by the Socialists to act as judge in the revolutionary tribunals.\nAfter his betrayal by the Russian generals, his overall atitude becomes much more remorseless and unforgiving, with him being the head judge in the judgement of Russians officers. Altough, he later comes to regret some of his actions.\nHistory #  [To be added]\nMacOS MacOS Content Linux Linux Content Windows Windows Content  --"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/latlander/docs/chapters/act_i/3_war/','title':"Chapter III: War is Declared / The Shelling of Liepaja",'section':"Act I",'content':"Chapter III #  War is Declared / The Shelling of Liepaja #  Autumn 1914.

He lost communication with his family when the war started.\nHe volunteers to join Latvian Riflemen in 1915, but being the youngest in his company, he was often lightly mocked by his fellow soldiers. In autumn 1915, he leaves his post in an heroic but foolish attempt to warn units south of his position that they will be annihilated if they do not retreat immediatly (it is later revealed he did that because he thought his brother Markuss could be amongst them)\nFinding Kris becomes Markuss\u0026rsquo;s main objective during the first half of the first book, but when he is later found in Death Island, he refuses to leave the army - regarding his duty as a soldier to his fellow brothers in arms. He is injured by mustard gas in Death Island and almost dies before being rescued by Markuss.\nBack in Riga, he is accused by Russian Officers (and specially, general Davilov) of cowardice before the enemy and being a spy for german forces, with the help of Markuss, he escapes prison - but instead of saving himself he rushes to the frontline to stop the attack on the Christmas Battles, as Wilks and the Latvian Riflemen will die since the Russians have decided to leave the Latvian to die. He manages to save the Riflemen but dies by his wounds.\nAppearance and Character #  Kris, like his brother, is an \u0026ldquo;golden haired\u0026rdquo; Keidann, but with a slim face and expressive eyes he inherited from his mother. He is less stocky than almost all of his fellow soldiers. Kris is at the same time very intelligent but also unaware of his social faus-passes. He likes to comments historical or cultural facts - mostly with a good humour - which often falls in deaf ears of his unwitting trench comrades. He speaks thing in a very fast but also dead-pan way, which is often received with laughter from his friends.\nA skilled musician and violinist, Kriss usually writes songs or poems about his experience. He rarely shows any of his writings to his friends, with the exception of a baudy poem he wrote to mock his friend\u0026rsquo;s battle injury. Even from a very young age, Kris has always showed an exceptional talent of understanding people and situations, and he has a very good technical knowledge on an increasing amount of skills - which is often contrasted by his inability to put it into practice.\nKris is not personally a skilled soldier and often does not put himself in harm\u0026rsquo;s way, but during the course of the book he changes from trying to prove himself to his brother and father to making real decisions to save his fellow soldiers, even tought it may cost his life.\nHistory #  [To be completed]\n"});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/latlander/docs/wiki/characters/anna/','title':"Anna",'section':"Characters",'content':"Anna Freimane is a Latvian nurse of the International Red Cross.

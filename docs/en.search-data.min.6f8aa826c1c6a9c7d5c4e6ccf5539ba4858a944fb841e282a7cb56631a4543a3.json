According to oral tradition he lived with his wife and children around Aizpute and was part of his King\u0026rsquo;s retinue. He was called into campaign as the pagans went to war with the Crusaders to defend their land. After a battle which cost the life of his king and his fellow brothers in arms, he returned to find his hometown burned and his sweetheart gone. With the german crusaders settling in to rule the land, he bent the knee and was baptized. His descendents would remain as small farmers bound to the orders of the local german barons for the next 800 years.\nColonel Jekabs Abrams #   \u0026ldquo;Colonel\u0026rdquo; Keidann, sometimes called \u0026ldquo;Old\u0026rdquo; Keidann, was the first Keidann to be appointed Steward of the manor and the patriarch of the modern Keidann family in Aizpute. Little is known about him except the fact he was born circa 1812 and had two sons. He went to serve in the Crimean War under the command of the local German baron and became his friend and confidant after saving his life in battle around 1855. In the same war, his eldest son disappeared. He was promoted to aide-de-camp (and thus, local people would call him \u0026ldquo;Colonel\u0026rdquo; even thought it was not his official title) and later Steward of the Baron\u0026rsquo;s Manor, a job which involved managing his household and fields. From that day on, the responsability of managing the manor would be passed down from generation to generation of Keidann children.\nHowever, he was also described as stern and distant man. He served faithfully as Steward for 17 years before his death and dedicated all his time to his responsabilities. Abrams describes his memories of him in his youth as a hollow-eyed man who did not love his grandson much. Whether this was his personality or grief from the loss of his wife and eldest son is not known. His legacy, however, cemented the Keidanns as a hard-working and respected family.\nThere is some evidence that even before him the family was already getting involved in local political affairs, as there is evidence his father was involved in the Napoleonic Wars in Russia to some extent, as the family has a small linen cloth worn by woman from that same time as a keepsake. It is also not know when Colonel Keidann joined the army before his son\u0026rsquo;s disappearance, or if it was the cause for him to go to war.\nAndrejs #   The eldest son of Colonel Keidann, Abram\u0026rsquo;s greatuncle was a young and willful youth, loved by both his father and his younger brother. Born circa 1830, not much is known about his personal life except the fact he joined the army shortly before the Crimean War and went to war, where he disappeared around 1854.\nFor many years following the war, people expected him to come back from Ottoman captivity, but he never returned, and was still remembered fondly by those who knew him.\nIt is indicated, thought not confirmed, that he worked closely to the baron\u0026rsquo;s household. He was known to be educated, as he loved art and literature, and was said to be incredibly skilled with horses and loved riding and supposedly gave riding lessons to the baron\u0026rsquo;s sons and daughters.\nIt is possible that he was romantically involved with the Baron\u0026rsquo;s daughter. As she is mentioned to have cried and she discovered he disappeared. No further explanation is given, however.\nMartins #   Martins was the youngest son of Jekabs Keidann. Not much is told about his life, and he himself admitted to being a simple man. He served the army but did not went to war, and for much of his life worked as a woodworker and lumberjack. He was not expected to inherit anything or have any responsabilities, so in these years he moved and worked in many surrounding villages other than Aizpute.\nHe met and became a friend of Old Gertners and the crescent baptist movement in Latvia. After his father\u0026rsquo;s death he became the Steward of the Manor for the Old German Baron, a position which he did not love but executed dutifully. As a reward for his services and in respect of his father, the baron gave him a small lot of land to build the church. After Gertners died he also took care of the sunday services.\nHe was known to read and write, but only read simple texts either related to woodwork, fieldwork or simple theology. He could play the violin incredibly well and loved jolly tunes. He had a certain distaste for anything he deemed too fanciful and lived a modest life. Altought a closed person, he was known to be incredibly kind and caring.\nIt is implied he had other older brothers other than Andrejs, the fate and where these brothers might be is unknown.\nJahn Abrams #   Jahnis Abrams, sometimes just called \u0026ldquo;Abe\u0026rdquo; or Mr. Keidann, was the son of Martins Keidann. Born around 1865, he grew up helping his father in the responsabilities of the German Manor. He loved reading and writing, but being of modest birth, he was only interested in simple literature. He also loved music but never had the talent to play the violin like his father did.\nHe dedicated his entire life for the Manor and the Church, and very rarely had time for other responsabilities. He met his future wife in a church trip to Jelgava in 1886 but they would marry many years later. From around 1886 to 1892 he served the obligatory military service in the Russian Empire, and was recognized as the best marksman in his regiment.\nThey had two children: Markuss and Kristaps, and lived a confortable. He had already assumed most of the duties of the Manor in 1892 and was named the Steward after Martin\u0026rsquo;s death in 1900 - but by that time the position had pratically become a caretaker of the house, as the german family that lived there rarely came to visit. He also temporarily took care of the church services from 1900, and headed the proposal of calling a dedicated baptist pastor from the Baptist association, thus bringing the Anderman Family to Aizpute.\nDespiste his bear-size like appearance, he was known to be extremely kind and with an unwavering sense of duty - but he also doubted his capacity to lead other people, and often questioned his abilities as a father face a modernizing world.\nIn 1905, he stood against the striking farmhands and workers as he considered his personal responsability to keep the Manor working. For that manner, he enlisted the help of his son Markuss, already grooming him to continue the tradition of stewardship. Later that year he stood against the more revolutionary sects in Aizpute, but helped the wounded during the 1905 Revolution.\nHe is the one to lead the wagon trail of refugees from Aizpute during the start of the German Invasion of Courland. With the decision to leave his home, closing his manor and his church hurting him deeply. He died after being shot by deserters in the road to Riga.\nMarkuss #  Kristaps #  Customs and Traits #  Keidanns have a reputation for being hard-workers and having a somber, melancholic-like temperament. Being related to the Curonian Kings and having (probably) been given more freedom than the other peasants during the medieval and modern age, they have kept strong family traditions. Be in their cooking and taste for poetric ballads to the their family pride and military tradition. Almost all known members of the family have served in the military at one point, with most of the members being affiliated with the Artillery Regiments. There\u0026rsquo;s also a tradition of passing from generation to generation a small linen cloth from the Napoleonic times from wife to wife of the eldest son.\nSince the 18th century, the family takes care of custodial responsabilities of the Baptist Church (which they helped found) and the local german manor, which they take care as Stewards: tending to the finances, reforms and good state and fields.\nAside from that, people who know Keidanns also usually recognize their tendency to have golden-brownish hair. They don\u0026rsquo;t have a confirmed coat of arms but usually identify with Courland\u0026rsquo;s heraldry.\nBreezehome \\ The Homestead #   The Keidann family has lived in the same plot of land for hundreds of years - a small Homestead in the pine woods belonging to the manor. The house is described as a \u0026ldquo;ship of Theseus\u0026rdquo; - with so many reforms that the original parts have long been replaced. Currently, it is made of mostly wood planks and small red bricks, with the kitchen center having a very old stone stove. The homestead has a small garden (usually shadowed by the tall trees) and other small wooden log buildings, such as a toolshack and a sauna.\nMarkuss notes that the house itself had the marks of many and many generations of Keidanns, with the support of the door to the kitchen having so many notches of the height of past children there was no longer space for Kriss.\nAs per Latvian tradition, every household is named, and the Homestead\u0026rsquo;s name, written on a small wood plaque, is Wesmamaya, or Breezehome in Latvian. It is unknown who first named it. And it is quite possible the naming was prior to Colonel Keidann\u0026rsquo;s time.\nThe house is surrounded by a small stone wall and Markuss recalls that sometimes there were stones stacks around the place - making him suggest there may have been stone buildings before.\nTrivia #    \u0026ldquo;Keidann\u0026rdquo; is the surname of a Latvian-Brazilian family estabilished in Ijui in the late 1890\u0026rsquo;s. Among the members of the Brazilian Keidann family were baptist pastors and members of the Latvian-Brazilian Baptist Association.\n  The modern latvian spelling of the name is \u0026ldquo;Keidans\u0026rdquo;, with variantions being Keidan in Yiddish and Kedahnen in German.\n  There is a Lithuanian city called Kėdainiai, whose foundation is attributed to a rich Curonian merchant called Keidangen\n  \u0026ldquo;Colonel\u0026rdquo;, such as the case of Jekabs Abrams, is a honorific title common in rural Brazil usually used by local landlords and large cattle ranchers, regardless of the true military title.\n  Both Abrams of the family, Jekabs Abrams and Jahnis Abrams, lose their sons in war. In this case, the imagery of the Binding of Isaac is evoked, with God asking Abraham to sacrifice his loved child. The passage in the Bible teaches that complete obedience to God should ignore doubts if the act itself seems morally right or wrong. In the bible, God replaces Isaac with a lamb in the sacrifice. In the story, however, both fathers lose their sons.\n  "},{"id":5,"href":"/Latlander/docs/wiki/characters/primary/markuss/","title":"Markuss Keidann","section":"Primary","content":" Second-Lieutenant Markuss Keidann is a Latvian commanding officer of the 3rd Courland Battalion (and later, Regiment) as a colleague of First-Lieutenant Wilks and acts as the main \u0026ldquo;protagonist\u0026rdquo; of the story. Born in 1895 in Aizpute and raised in the local baptist church, he was the oldest son of Mr. and Mme. Keidann and brother of Kriss Keidann, whom he had a rocky relationship.\nBook 1 #  Act I\nMarkuss was born in Breezehome, the Keidann\u0026rsquo;s ancestral home near Aizputes Manor, in 1895. The first child of Abrams Keidann and Lavise Keidann, he grew up in the local baptist church. As a child he often accompanied his father in his work and church reunions, and was well-loved by both his parents and the other villagers of Aizpute.\nHe was greatly excited when he discovered he would have a brother, but due to Kriss' poor health, Markuss often found himself waiting for hours outside his door to play. He was very close to his paternal grandmother, who often told him stories about his ancestors, and was deeply affected when she passed away in 1900. Because of her stories, Markuss loved knights and often imagined swords when playing with sticks.\nMarkuss met the Andermann family in Christmas 1902 and quickly became friends with the Andermann brothers. He was also enrolled when the local school opened but due to his older age he never grew into a great student as his brother. He helped Anna emotionally when her mother was sick in 1904 and was devastated when the Andermanns moved away in following the 1905 Revolution.\nDuring the 1905 Revolution in Aizpute, he escaped the protective curfew to meet Anna. In the same day, he gained his distinctive scar in his left cheek after he stood up to the Commander of a Russian Punitive Expedition, only to be saved from further physical punishment by a soldier. An experience that deeply inspired him to become a soldier and protect others.\nFollowing 1905, his father started taking him to work in the manor and the fields to compensate for the lack of workers. Due to this, Markuss grew up as a hard working but lonely teenager. He also resented being expected to continue the Keidann tradition of being the steward of the local german manor and longed for a life of his own.\nIn his 18th Birthday in 1913, Markuss has an altercation with his Father - who seemingly forgot his birthday - only for him to revel his surprise: teaching how to hunt. While hunting Markuss expresses his wish to join the Russian Imperial Army, a decision which his father is hesitant to accept, warning Markuss that while he wants his son to follow his dreams, a career in the army is not what he may expect to be. Both men also discuss whether Kriss should be allowed to go study music in Riga\u0026rsquo;s Conservatory. For the first time, Markuss feels he talks to his father as an equal.\nLater, his mother and father accompany him to the recruiting station in Jelgava, and Markuss is told by the recruiter of how the Army has enacted further restrictions on local minorities, but decides to enlist anyway. After his mother displays the first symptomps of tuberculosis in the travel back, Markuss shames Kriss for not helping the family.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/Latlander/docs/wiki/characters/secondary/old_keidann/","title":"Old Keidann","section":"Secondary","content":"\u0026ldquo;Old Keidann\u0026rdquo; was the patriarch of house Keidann of Aizpute.

Wilks","section":"Primary","content":" Lieutenant Wilks is a Latvian-Jewish commanding officer of the 3rd Courland Battalion (and later, Regiment). An accomplished commander, Wilks' is sometimes regarded as ruthless or unbending, being called Ol' Wilks or Slavedriver by his soldiers. He is a veteran of the invasion of East Prussia and the fall of Jelgava before the formation of the Latvian Riflemen. After the Christmas Battles in January 1917, he is removed from service after retreating without orders and a mutiny against General Davilov and goes on to have a pivotal role in the Russian Civil War commanding the Red Latvian Riflemen, until returning to fight for the independence of Latvia.\nAt the end of the war, Wilks has been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel of the Latvian forces. He eventually receives the moniker of the Wolf of Vidzeme for his actions.\nAppearance and Character #  Wilks' face is described as palid, borderline sickly white, with hazy distant grey eyes and a pine-brown short hair. In the beggining of the book, he keeps his beard trimmed and his hair kept but as the book progresses the grooming standarts of the battalion and of himself start to decay. He bears a scar in his neck, sometimes hidden by his uniform, from his experience in Prussia.\nDespiste not being muscular or tall, he remains an imposing figure. His gaze is sometimes described as either incredibly stern or incredibly unconcerned, depending of the matter at hand. Extremely learned, he is patient and rarely raises his voice to speak. He speaks in a paced, monotone manner and rarely demonstrates any emotion, altough he sometimes remarks things with irony.\nTough mild-mannered, Wilks is considered remorseless, cold, cunning, rarely-forgiving but also a strong-willed and resoluted commander. In battle, he is not foreign to the idea of deadly battle plans or sometimes even sacrificing units if it is required to achieve victory, but more often than not manages to win with \u0026ldquo;the least casualties\u0026rdquo;. While not loved by his soldiers or sometimes feared, he does hold the respect of those he commands.\nPersonally, Wilks regards the duty of a soldier as no different from anyother duty. It is the job of a soldier to follow orders and the job of officers to command. He firmly believes that it is morally unjust to disobey orders, since it can endanger your fellow soldier and that only fighting to the end will end the war. He often evokes the idea of lesser evil to justify his actions, altought he recognizes it\u0026rsquo;s only a pragmatic stance.\nAs the story progresses, Wilks comes to lose part of his faith in following the orders of Russian generals, but remains strictly committed to winning the war until the deadly Christmas Battles, where he loses 1/3 of his soldiers after being abandoned and betrayed by the Russian Generals. In the aftermath of the Christmas Battles, he supports Markuss Keidann and is consequently imprisioned and dismissed from the army, being imprisoned until February 1917, when he is released by the Socialists to act as judge in the revolutionary tribunals.\nAfter his betrayal by the Russian generals, his overall atitude becomes much more remorseless and unforgiving, with him being the head judge in the judgement of Russians officers. Altough, he later comes to regret some of his actions.\nHistory #  [To be added]\nMacOS MacOS Content #  Linux Linux Content #  Windows Windows Content #   --"},{"id":9,"href":"/Latlander/docs/wiki/characters/primary/kris/","title":"Kris Keidann","section":"Primary","content":" Private Kristoffs Keidann is a Latvian soldier of the 3rd Courland Battalion (and later, Regiment).

He lost communication with his family when the war started.\nHe volunteers to join Latvian Riflemen in 1915, but being the youngest in his company, he was often lightly mocked by his fellow soldiers. In autumn 1915, he leaves his post in an heroic but foolish attempt to warn units south of his position that they will be annihilated if they do not retreat immediatly (it is later revealed he did that because he thought his brother Markuss could be amongst them)\nFinding Kris becomes Markuss\u0026rsquo;s main objective during the first half of the first book, but when he is later found in Death Island, he refuses to leave the army - regarding his duty as a soldier to his fellow brothers in arms. He is injured by mustard gas in Death Island and almost dies before being rescued by Markuss.\nBack in Riga, he is accused by Russian Officers (and specially, general Davilov) of cowardice before the enemy and being a spy for german forces, with the help of Markuss, he escapes prison - but instead of saving himself he rushes to the frontline to stop the attack on the Christmas Battles, as Wilks and the Latvian Riflemen will die since the Russians have decided to leave the Latvian to die. He manages to save the Riflemen but dies by his wounds.\nAppearance and Character #  Kris, like his brother, is an \u0026ldquo;golden haired\u0026rdquo; Keidann, but with a slim face and expressive eyes he inherited from his mother. He is less stocky than almost all of his fellow soldiers. Kris is at the same time very intelligent but also unaware of his social faus-passes. He likes to comments historical or cultural facts - mostly with a good humour - which often falls in deaf ears of his unwitting trench comrades. He speaks thing in a very fast but also dead-pan way, which is often received with laughter from his friends.\nA skilled musician and violinist, Kriss usually writes songs or poems about his experience. He rarely shows any of his writings to his friends, with the exception of a baudy poem he wrote to mock his friend\u0026rsquo;s battle injury. Even from a very young age, Kris has always showed an exceptional talent of understanding people and situations, and he has a very good technical knowledge on an increasing amount of skills - which is often contrasted by his inability to put it into practice.\nKris is not personally a skilled soldier and often does not put himself in harm\u0026rsquo;s way, but during the course of the book he changes from trying to prove himself to his brother and father to making real decisions to save his fellow soldiers, even tought it may cost his life.\nHistory #  [To be completed]\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/Latlander/docs/wiki/characters/primary/anna/","title":"Anna","section":"Primary","content":" Anna Freimane is a Latvian nurse of the International Red Cross.

In 1915, she briefly meets Kris during the health inspection of those that volunteered to the Latvian Riflemen. It was also during that time that she sees the expulsion of the Jews of Kurzeme by the Russian Army, the evacuation of Latvians from Riga and the imprisionment of Baptists Pastors (including her father) to Siberia.\nShe later reconnects with Markuss after the combats of Death Island in 1916 and they begin a romantic relationship, altought she is troubled by the idea of having to someday see Markuss die, or worse, choose to save another life instead of his'.\nIn the aftermath of the Christmas Battles in 1917, she is pivotal in protecting Markuss, Kris and Wilks from general Davilov, since he has no jurisdiction to imprison soldiers in a hospital controlled by the Red Cross.

Abrams \u0026ldquo;Abe\u0026rdquo; Keidann (commonly called Mr. Keidann or simply as Father by his sons) was a Latvian Homesteader and Steward for a local german family in Aizpute. He was married to Lavise Keidann and had two sons: Markuss and Kris Keidann.\nHistory #  Before: Abrams was born around the early 1860\u0026rsquo;s in Aizpute to the traditional Keidann family, being raised with a solemn sense of duty and unwavering honor. Abrams served the Imperial Army for 6 in the 1880\u0026rsquo;s as a conscript.\nis a Latvian lumberman father of Markuss and Kris Keidann. Born in Aizpute to the olden Keidann family, he worked his entire life as a lumberman and carpenter. He also served the obligatory service in the Russian Imperial Army in his youth, being one of the best marksman in his unit.\nA faithful baptist, he was the main responsible for the construction of the Baptist Temple in Aizpute and always helped prepare the temple for christmas - a season he loved. In 1905, he lost his unborn daughter and barely lost his wife as the church was burn down by the Russian Army.\nHe later had trouble raising his two kids. Altough a loving and caring father, he was sometimes distant or too strict, because he feared losing them. His promise of letting Kris join the Symphonic Orchestra if he passed the exams, and his change of heart, led to Kris leaving home. He died in 1915 as the German Army invaded Latvia.\nAppearance and Character #  Mr. Keidann is a tall, stocky man. His golden/auburn hair and beard gave him a wild, lion-like appearence. He was extremely patient and well manered and tried to raise his sons as best as he could, but he also admits his faults. He was overprotective of his sons after losing his infant daughter in 1905.\nWith Markuss, Mr. Keidann always pushed him to do heavy work and help him to cut trees to pay for Kris' studies, and also did not let Markuss leave home until after he served in the army and married, which led to Markuss resent a little his father\u0026rsquo;s controll.\nWith Kris, Mr. Keidann always saw his father\u0026rsquo;s talent with music and the violin and wanted to be able to afford Kris' education and entrance in Riga\u0026rsquo;s Symphonic Orchestra (it is implied Mr. Keidann\u0026rsquo;s father was very talented with a violin, but had to be a lumberjack in his life because he couldn\u0026rsquo;t pay for the education, and Mr. Keidann always wanted to play music as well as Kris did, but never had the opportunity), but when Kris finally passed the exams, he feared losing his son and prohibited his leave.\n"}]
